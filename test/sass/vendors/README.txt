The testing area is not a demo, it is just a staging area to test new features
and to demonstrate where you would put Smoother in the 7-1 Sass folder
architecture. To use the testing area, copy the smthr and betterize folders from the src
folder and place them here. From the bash command line, when in the project root
folder, smthr, you can run the following command to do this:

cp -r src/{betterize,smthr} test/sass/vendors/
