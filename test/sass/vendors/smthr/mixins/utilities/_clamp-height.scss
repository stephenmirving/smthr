/// Gives an element dynamic height by taking an absolute length as a min-height
/// value for the first parameter, a relative length to use for the height
/// property, and then another absolute length for the max-height property.
/// Follows the same argument syntax as the CSS clamp() method, and the
/// clamp-height mixin and clamp-val function in this library. If you want to
/// get even more responsive, pass clamp(), calc(), min(), and max() functions
/// for these values.
///
/// @param {Number} $min - The minimum height. Should be an absolute length value
/// or a function that resolves to one.
/// @param {Number} $rel - The relative length height of the element. Use units
/// like vh, %, em, etc. or a function using relative units.
/// @param {Number} $max - The maximum height. Should be an absolute length value
/// or a function that resolves to one.
