/// Gives an element dynamic height by taking an absolute length as a min-height
/// value for the first parameter, a relative length to use for the height
/// property, and then another absolute length for the max-height property.
/// Follows the same argument syntax as the CSS clamp() method, and the
/// clamp-height mixin and clamp-val function in this library. If you want to
/// get even more responsive, pass clamp(), calc(), min(), and max() functions
/// for these values.

/// @param {Length} $max - The maximum height. Should be an absolute length value
